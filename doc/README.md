* Started on October 31st, ended on December 15th, estimated 2,500 hours total amongst all group members spent on the project
* Each person's role in the project: 
    * Archana:
    * Nik:
    * Dara:
    * Ryan:
    * Samarth:
    * Ian:
    * Aaron:
    * Sam:
    * Owen: responsible for managing authoring actions and conditions, loading and saving information about them to spriteObjects, and passing and receiving that information from the data stored in XML files for games.
    * David: 
* Resources: Java documentation on list change listeners, lambda expressions, and layout components like HBoxes, VBoxes, TreeViews, and tabs, Program Creek for examples on list change listeners, StackOverflow for researching specific, small algorithms that were useful, and newthinktank.com for an example on MVC.
* Files used to start the project: Scenecontroller, which creates the welcome screen from which the user can either play a pre-existing game, build their own game, or view the settings for the game. 
* Files used to test the project: 
* Errors our program can handle without crashing: incorrectly filing in information about actions and conditions or leaving fields blank in the tree, incorrectly pairing a variable name to a sprite object to assign for a condition or action, and failing to pair at least one condition with every action.
* Data or resource files required by the project: in the TextResources package, there are several properties containing titles and labels used in the conditions and actions tab. 
* Information about using the program: to play a game, select the play game button in the menu and click on a previously created game.
